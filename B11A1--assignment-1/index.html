        slip away because of our mistakes. I fervently appeal to everybody to
        stay calm. Please refrain from all kinds of violence. I appeal to all
        students, members of all political parties and non-political people to
        stay calm. This is our beautiful country with lots of exciting
        possibilities. We must protect and make it a wonderful country for us
        and for our future generations.Our youth is ready to give this
        leadership in creating a new world. Let us not miss the chance by going

        more enemies. Be calm and get ready to build the country. If we take the
        path of violence everything will be destroyed. Please stay calm. Help
        those around you to stay calm.
